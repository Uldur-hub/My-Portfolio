Hi, I’m **Hugo**, a curious mind with a passion for learning, problem-solving, and creating meaningful connections between ideas, people, and opportunities.  

I’ve worn many hats throughout my career, from working on **data analysis** to exploring **user engagement & management strategies** and **Customer Success Management**. My journey has taught me that adaptability, curiosity, and a willingness to dig deeper are just as important as technical skills.  

### What I Do  
I enjoy tackling challenges that require both **analytical thinking** and **creative solutions**. Whether it’s finding patterns in data, improving a process, or building something from scratch, I thrive when I can combine **structure with imagination**.  

### My Approach  
I believe in working with integrity, paying attention to the details, and focusing on solutions that make a measurable difference. I’m a strong believer that **good work comes from discipline, consistency and an open mind**, and that every challenge is an opportunity to grow.  

### Beyond Work  
Outside of my professional life, you can find me exploring **Fantasy Role-Playing Games** like Dungeons & Dragons, reading **Philosophy** or **Classical Literature**, **Golfing**, **Mountain Hiking** and learning about different cultures through travel.
